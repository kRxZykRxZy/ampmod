                        Some extensions must communicate with external APIs to
                        function. For example, the translate and text-to-speech
                        extensions rely on the Scratch API, which is covered by
                        the

                        </a>
                        . To improve performance, some extensions access{" "}
                        {APP_NAME}
                        's APIs instead, where both the request (for example,

                        the extension to access an untrusted website; however we

                        computer, the editor will ask for permission to load the
                        extension. If you approve this dialog, the extension can
                        bypass the permission dialogs that official extensions
                        show.
