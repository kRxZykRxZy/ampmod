    "faq.why.q": "Why was {APP_NAME} created?",
    "faq.why.a1": "Scratch is tightly controlled by its developers at the Scratch Foundation, who target it at beginners. Because of this, the Scratch Team has rejected several complex features, and people eventually stop using it and learn languages like Python instead.",
